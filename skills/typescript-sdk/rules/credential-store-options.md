# Credential Store Options

## Credential Store Options

MCP servers and external agents may require authentication for secure access. The Inkeep agent framework supports storing these credentials in three different ways:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Nango Store (Recommended)" icon="brand/Nango" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/nango">
    **Best for:** Development or Production environments with OAuth2.1/PKCE flows and complex integrations

    **Pros:**

    * Automatic token refresh for OAuth
    * Supports additional metadata headers
    * Works with complex OAuth flows (OAuth2.0/PKCE)
    * Managed service (self-hosted or cloud)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Keychain Store (Default)" icon="LuLock" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/keychain">
    **Best for:** Local development with OAuth services

    **Cons:**

    * Not suitable for production
    * No automatic token refresh
    * Requires manual re-authentication when tokens expire
    * Does not support additional metadata headers
  </Card>

  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="LuDatabase" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/environment-variables">
    **Best for:** Simple API keys and bearer tokens in development or production

    **Pros:**

    * Direct configuration via TypeScript SDK

    **Cons:**

    * Does not support additional metadata headers
    * Does not support OAuth2.1/PKCE flows
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Environment-aware Credentials

When you need different credentials for different environments (e.g., development vs. production), you can take advantage of [environment-aware credentials](/typescript-sdk/credentials/env-aware-credentials). This approach allows you to:

* Define separate credentials for each environment
* Automatically load the correct credentials based on your deployment environment
* Keep your development and production credentials cleanly separated
* Easily switch between environments using the CLI's `--env` flag

Learn more about setting up environment-aware credentials in the [dedicated guide](/typescript-sdk/credentials/env-aware-credentials).
