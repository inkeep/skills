# Credential Store Options

## Credential Store Options

MCP servers and external agents may require authentication for secure access. The Inkeep agent framework supports storing these credentials in three different ways:

<OptionCards>
  <OptionCard title="Nango Store" icon="brand/Nango" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/nango" badge="Recommended" highlighted cta="Learn More">
    **Best for:** Development or Production environments with OAuth2.1/PKCE flows and complex integrations

    * Automatic token refresh for OAuth
    * Supports additional metadata headers
    * Works with complex OAuth flows (OAuth2.0/PKCE)
    * Managed service (self-hosted or cloud)
  </OptionCard>

  <OptionCard title="Keychain Store" icon="LuLock" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/keychain" badge="Default" cta="Learn More">
    **Best for:** Local development with OAuth services

    * Not suitable for production
    * No automatic token refresh
    * Requires manual re-authentication when tokens expire
    * Does not support additional metadata headers
  </OptionCard>

  <OptionCard title="Environment Variables" icon="LuDatabase" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/environment-variables" cta="Learn More">
    **Best for:** Simple API keys and bearer tokens in development or production

    * Direct configuration via TypeScript SDK
    * Does not support additional metadata headers
    * Does not support OAuth2.1/PKCE flows
  </OptionCard>
</OptionCards>

## Environment-aware Credentials

When you need different credentials for different environments (e.g., development vs. production), you can take advantage of [environment-aware credentials](/typescript-sdk/credentials/env-aware-credentials). This approach allows you to:

* Define separate credentials for each environment
* Automatically load the correct credentials based on your deployment environment
* Keep your development and production credentials cleanly separated
* Easily switch between environments using the CLI's `--env` flag

Learn more about setting up environment-aware credentials in the [dedicated guide](/typescript-sdk/credentials/env-aware-credentials).
