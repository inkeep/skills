# Runtime Limits Configuration

## How Runtime Configuration Works

### Two Types of Limits

**1. API-Configurable Limits** (set per agent/sub-agent via manage-api)

* Configured in your agent definitions using `stopWhen`
* Controls agent-specific behavior
* See [Agent Settings - StopWhen](/typescript-sdk/agent-settings#configuring-stopwhen)

**2. Runtime Environment Limits** (set via environment variables)

* System-wide defaults and maximum allowed values
* Controls infrastructure-level constraints
* Documented in this guide

### Configuration Hierarchy

When an agent executes:

1. Uses agent-specific `stopWhen` settings if configured
2. Falls back to runtime environment defaults
3. Cannot exceed runtime environment maximums

### Understanding the Constants Architecture

The runtime environment limits are defined as TypeScript constants in the `@inkeep/agents-core` package. These constants are organized into two categories based on their purpose:

**1. Schema Validation Constants** (`packages/agents-core/src/constants/schema-validation/defaults.ts`)

* Define **API-level validation limits** (min, max, default values)
* Control what values users can configure via the manage-api
* Used in Zod schemas to validate agent configuration requests
* Examples: Transfer count limits, generation step limits, prompt character limits

**2. Runtime Execution Constants - Shared** (`packages/agents-core/src/constants/execution-limits-shared/defaults.ts`)

* Define **internal runtime behavior** limits
* Control infrastructure-level timeouts, retries, and constraints
* Shared across both manage-api and run-api services
* Examples: MCP connection timeouts, conversation history token limits

**3. Runtime Execution Constants - Run-API** (`packages/agents-run-api/src/constants/execution-limits/defaults.ts`)

* Define **run-api specific runtime behavior** limits
* Control execution engine timeouts, retries, and resource constraints
* Only used by the run-api service (not shared with manage-api)
* Examples: LLM generation timeouts, function tool sandbox limits, streaming buffer sizes

Each constant includes detailed inline documentation explaining its purpose, behavior, and impact on the runtime. **The TypeScript constant files are the source of truth** for default values and available overrides—not `.env.example`.

All constants can be overridden via environment variables prefixed with `AGENTS_`. For example:

```bash
# Override a schema validation constant
AGENTS_AGENT_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT=50

# Override a runtime execution constant
AGENTS_MCP_TOOL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
```

## Use Case: Long-Running Orchestration Agents

For agents that orchestrate complex workflows (like coding agents that run for hours), you'll want to increase various limits and timeouts.

### Recommended Configuration

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Agent Execution - Allow more sub-agent transfers for complex orchestration
AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT=50  # Default: 10
AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_MAX=2000    # Default: 1000

# Sub-Agent Turns - Allow more LLM generation steps per turn
AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_DEFAULT=30  # Default: 12
AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_MAX=2000    # Default: 1000

# LLM Timeouts - Increase for longer-running operations
AGENTS_LLM_GENERATION_FIRST_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS_STREAMING=600000   # 10min, Default: 4.5min
AGENTS_LLM_GENERATION_SUBSEQUENT_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS=180000        # 3min, Default: 1.5min

# Function Tools - Allow longer execution for complex operations
AGENTS_FUNCTION_TOOL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS_DEFAULT=120000  # 2min, Default: 30sec

# MCP Tools - Increase timeout for external tool operations
AGENTS_MCP_TOOL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_DEFAULT=180000  # 3min, Default: 1min

# Session Management - Keep tool results cached longer
AGENTS_SESSION_TOOL_RESULT_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000  # 30min, Default: 5min

# Streaming - Allow streams to run longer
AGENTS_STREAM_MAX_LIFETIME_MS=1800000  # 30min, Default: 10min
```

<Note>
  `AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT` sets the default number of transfers allowed between sub-agents in a turn when no agent-specific limit is configured. `AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_MAX` sets the maximum number of transfers that can be configured via the manage-api for any agent.

  The same pattern applies to `AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_DEFAULT` and `AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_MAX`.
</Note>

### Why These Settings?

* **Transfer Count**: Coding orchestration often involves many handoffs between specialist agents (planning → implementation → testing → refinement)
* **Generation Steps**: Each coding operation may require multiple tool calls (read files, analyze, write code, run tests)
* **Timeouts**: Code generation and analysis can take time, especially for large files or complex refactoring
* **Cache Duration**: Keeps tool results available throughout long sessions for artifact processing
